<H2>SCADE or Simulink importers</H2>
<p>
The functional importers create AADL models skeletons using
a functional model such as SCADE or Simulink. SCADE or Simulink
provides a language to describe a functional description
using a graphical notation. However, these models do not show
many deployment information, which may result in limited
analysis. 
</p>
<p>
Such models are often used to simulate and prototype the
system before architecture design efforts. For that purpose,
import these functional models can help to make the initial
models by automatically generating a model skeleton
from existing prototyping efforts. The model skeleton
can then be refine according to the design specification.

<h2>Using the plug-in</h2>
<p>
In both case, before selecting the menu, you have
to select an <strong>empty directory</strong> in 
your OSATE installation (see picture below).
 This directory will then contain
the generated AADL model.

<h3>Importing Simulink Models</h3>
<p>
To import a Simulink model, make sure you
have selected an empty directory in your workspace
and then, select the menu entry
<strong>Import Simulink model</strong>
under the <strong>Analyses</strong> menu.
This is shown in the figure below in the 
purple box.
</p>


<h3>Importing SCADE Models</h3>
<p>
To import a SCADE model, make sure you
have selected an empty directory in your workspace
and then, select the menu entry
<strong>Import SCADE model</strong>
under the <strong>Analyses</strong> menu.
This is shown in the figure below in the 
red box.
