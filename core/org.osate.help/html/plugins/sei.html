<H2>OSATE plug-in: SEI validation plug-ins</H2>


<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
The analysis plugins designed by the SEI are available in the <em>Analyses</em>, as
shown in the picture below. These plugins mostly acts on the instance model and thus
you need to select the instance model and the root system instance when invoking these
plugins.
</p>

<img src="analysis-menu.png"/>


<p>
Most of the plugins report errors and information in the Eclipse <em>Problems</em>
view. For this reason, this is always worth to activate this view when
using the validation plug-ins. You can activate this view by selecting
the following menus: <em>Window</em>, <em>Show View</em> and then <em>Problems</em>, as
shown in the following picture.
</p>
<img src="activate-problem-view.png"/>

<p>
Eclipse classifies Marker information into different categories: errors, warning and
information. By default the Eclipse problem view only shows errors, so you may not see the results of an analysis if no errors are involved.
</p>
<p>
You can change the default setting by following the instructions at
<strong><a href="../start/eclipse-basics.html">Eclipse Basics</a></strong>.
</p>


<h3>Statistics plug-in</h3>
<p>
This analysis is applicable to AADL specifications and system instances.  It is invoked using �Analyses > Architecture > Model statistics� in the menu bar or the button in the toolbar.
</p>
<p>
This analysis collects model statistics of two kinds and can be invoked on both declarative AADL models and AADL instance models.  In both cases it keeps track of the number of declarations of different kinds in all declarative model files in the workspace.  When invoked on an AADL instance model it also keeps track of components of different categories, connections, flows, etc. of the instance model. Figure 27 illustrates how the model statistics plug-in reports its results both through a dialog box and as information markers in the �Problems� view.
</p>
<p>
This plug-in aims at making statistics on your model: number of components,
categories of components, etc. This plug-in is more a support
for new plug-in developer and start with an established code base
they can re-use.
</p>

<h3>Flow Latency Analysis</h3>
<p>
This analysis plug-in determines the latency of flow implementations declared for components and compares it to the latency specified by the corresponding flow specification of the component.  A detailed description of its current implementation can be found in Section 10.
</p>
<p> 
The analysis performs this check for all flow implementations and their corresponding flow specifications for all component classifier declarations.  This analysis may be invoked on a system instance or a component implementation using �Analyses > Check Flow Latency� or the button in the toolbar.
</p>
<p> 
The latency of a flow implementation is determined as the sum of all:
 </p>
<p>
The connection latencies in the flow implementation; the connection latency is determined by the Latency property value�if not declared, it is assumed to be zero.
</p>
<p>
The flowspec latencies of all subcomponent flowspecs in the flow implementation; the subcomponent flowspec latency is determined by its Latency property value�if no value was declared and the component is a thread, then the period is used for periodic threads, and the deadline for all other threads. Otherwise, zero latency is assumed.
 </p>
<p>
The resulting latency value is then stored as a Latency property association of the flow implementation. 
</p>
<p>
Finally, the latency value is compared to the latency value of the flow specification with the same name in the component type corresponding to the component implementation.  If the flow implementation latency value exceeds that of the flow specification an error is reported.
 </p>
<p>
A second form of flow latency analysis is performed for end-to-end flow specifications across components.  This can take place in two ways.  First, it can analyze flows across system components that play the role of system partitions that are scheduled as virtual processors, and that do not have to be further elaborated.  The latency contribution due to partition execution is determined by the property SEI::Partition_Latency.    This permits early latency analysis of integrated systems through a high-level  model of major subsystems based on specification information without expanding into subsystem details.
 </p>
<p>
Second, end-to-end flow through threads, devices, and processor can be analyzed.  In this case, both the flow specification latency and the latency due to execution characteristics such as period, deadline, and immediate or delayed connection, are taken into account in calculating the total latency. 
</p>
<p>
Communication latency is currently taken into account if specified as connection latency.
 </p>
<p>

<p>
This plug-in performs a latency analysis of your connection flows.
More information about this plug-in can be also found in the
<a href="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/reports/07tn010.pdf" target="blank">following technical report</a>.
In order to work correctly, you must model a system with flow and define 
the property <em>Transmission_Time</em> on <em>bus</em> components.
You can see the definition of such a property above:
</p>
<pre>
bus mybus
properties
   Transmission_Time => [ Fixed => 0 ms .. 10ms;
                          PerByte => 0 ms .. 10 ms; ];
end mybus; 
</pre>

<p>
You must also define the <em>SEI::BandWidthBudget</em> property,
like that:
</p>
<pre>
SEI::BandWidthBudget => 1.0 KBytesps; 
</pre>

<p>
Also, when declaring <strong>flows</strong>, you must declare
the <em>latency</em> property, like the following:
</p>
<pre>
process myprocess
features
   pout: out data port;
   busAccess: requires bus access mybus;
flows
   myflow_src: flow source pout {latency => 1 ns .. 2 ns; } ; 
end myprocess;
</pre>

<p>
Once your model is done, you can execute the analysis from the menu on the
instance model. To do so, select the root node of the instance
model and click on <em>Analysis</em> and then <em>Check Flow Latency</em>.
Once the plug-in finished, a report is generated in a directory called <em>reports</em>,
it can be opened with a spreadsheet such as LibreOffice or Microsoft Excel.
</p>


<h3>Weight Plug-In</h3>
<p>
Once the analysis is done, a report is generated in the <em>reports/</em>
directory, in the root directory of the AADL project. On completion,
the plug-in also a dialog that summarizes the result of the analysis (as shown below).
</p>
<img src="weight-dialog.png"/>
<p>
When the system is being analyzed, the following properties are analyzed:
</p>
<ul>
<li>SEI::NetWeight</li>
<li>SEI::GrossWeight</li>
<li>SEI::WeightLimit</li>
</ul>
<p>
These properties are associated to the following elements:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>connection</strong></li>
	<li><strong>components</strong>, except for process, virtual bus and virtual processor</li>
</ul>


<h3>Check Miss Rates</h3>
<p>
This analysis checks whether the miss rates in streams communicated through ports are consistent, i.e., the miss rate of an out port does not exceed the miss rate of an in port. The miss rate of an out port represents the maximum miss rate of the generated stream through this port.  The miss rate in an in port represents the maximum miss rate that a component is willing to handle.
 
This analysis is invoked using Analyses > Architecture > Check Miss Rates in the menu bar or the button in the toolbar.  It may only be applied to AADL Specifications.
 
Miss rates are specified on ports using the property SEI::StreamMissRate, a aadlreal- valued property defined in the SEI property set, i.e.,
</p>
<pre>
Property set SEI is
 
  StreamMissRate: aadlreal applies to (port);
 
End SEI;
</pre>
<p>
The analysis performs this check for all connections if either or both the source or destination ports have a value for this property.  The check can be invoked on an AADL XML file, or on any of the AADL model objects in the AADL Object Editor. In both cases it is applied to all connections in the AADL model.  A connection is reported if the miss rate of the destination port is lower than the miss rate of the source port of any connection.
 
You can use this analysis on any AADL model that has property values for this property associated with some of its ports.
</p>
<p>
A code snippet from the SunseekerDemo example:
</p>
<pre>
process Sunseekerplant_Type
 
   features
 
      Controllerinput : in  data port Beacon_Standard::Single_Float;
 
      Outputfeedback  : out data port Beacon_Standard::Single_Float
 
      { SEI::StreamMissRate => 0.06;};
</pre>


<h3>Analyze Bound Bus Load</h3>
<p>
This function extracts the property <strong>SEI::BandWidthCapacity</strong> on each bus.
Then, the function retrieves the bandwidth required by each connection bound to this
bus and check that the bandwidth capacity of the bus is enough to provide enough
capacity for its bound connections.
</p>
<p>
To do so, the function process each connection bound to the bus and computes
the bandwidth budget for this connection:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>By retrieving the budget value associated to this connection
	    specified with the <strong>SEI::BandWidthBudget</strong>
	    property on the connection.
	 </li>
	 <li>By computing the budget value of the connection
	     using the size of the data type used on the connection
	     and the thread period (using the <strong>Period</strong> property),
	     assuming the thread
	     output one data instance per period.
	  </li>
</ul>

<p>
Upon successful analysis, the plugin reports metrics
in a dialog box, as shown in the following picture.
</p>
<img src="bound-bus-bandwidth-analysis.png"/>

<h3>Analyze Bus Load</h3>
<p>
This function extracts the property <strong>SEI::BandWidthCapacity</strong> on each bus.
Then, the function retrieves the bandwidth required by each connection bound to this
bus and check that the bandwidth capacity of the bus is enough to provide enough
capacity for its bound connections. It process connections between system, including
<strong>port connection</strong> and <strong>bus access</strong> connections.
</p>
<p>
To do so, the function process each connection bound to the bus and computes
the bandwidth budget for this connection:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>By retrieving the budget value associated to this connection
	    specified with the <strong>SEI::BandWidthBudget</strong>
	    property on the connection.
	 </li>
	 <li>By computing the budget value of the connection
	     using the size of the data type used on the connection
	     and the thread period (using the <strong>Period</strong> property),
	     assuming the thread
	     output one data instance per period. This is also
	     the way it computes the size of the data being transmitted
	     on the bus.
	  </li>
</ul>
<p>
The policy to get the data being transmitted on the bus is the following:
<ul>
	<li>It retrieves the value of the <strong>SEI::BandWidthBudget</strong>
	    on the connection <strong>AND</strong> computes the actual size
	    being transmitted over the bus.
	</li>
	<li>If the value of the actual value being transmitted (the one computed
		from the port data size and the thread period) is bigger than the value
		from the property associated to the connection, we use it. Otherwise,
		the function uses the one from the property.
	</li>
	<li>
		It checks that the involved components (both source and destination) are active in the current mode. If yes,
		it adds to the total bandwidth use the usage of the component.
	</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The functions also provides the ability to make an analysis on
a per-mode basis: if a component that communicates
is not active in a mode, then, the data it sends/receives
is not taken into account.
</p>
<p>
Upon successful analysis, the plugin reports metrics
in a dialog box, as shown in the following picture. It also produces
reports in a CSV file format in a new <strong>report</strong>
directory.
</p>

<h3>Analyze Bus Power Draw</h3>
<p>
There are two forms of power related analyses. The first form utilizes classifier type
checking on connections to identify mismatch in supplied and required power
characteristics. In this case a bus models the power supply. It is defined with several
implementations, each representing a different (set of) power characteristics. For
example, we may have two implementations representing different voltages. Power
consumers define requires bus access features choosing as classifier the desired power
characteristics by naming the appropriate implementation. Once the bus access
connection is established the AADL semantic checker will detect mismatching classifier
names.
</p>
<p>
The second form of power related analysis models the power capacity of a physical
system entity that is modeled by a bus. Power is drawn from this entity by components
that are connected to it via bus access connection. The power supply scenario is one
example. A second example is a bus such as USB that provides power to connected
devices.
</p>
<p>
We have introduced two properties, PowerCapacity and PowerBudget, for that purpose.
Its values are real with units of mW, W, KW for wattage (an equivalent measure could
have been impedance). The PowerCapacity can be associated with Bus components,
while PowerBudget is associated with the requires bus access feature of the consuming
component. As before, the property value can be specified with the component type, the
component implementation, the subcompone nt, or even component instances in the
instance model.
</p>
<p>
The power consumption analysis is invoked through a toolbar command, or through the
Analysis menu and the Architecture submenu.
</p>
<p>
The power consumption analysis totals up the drawn power on each of the bus instances
that have a power capacity and compares it to the power capacity of that bus. The results
are reported via dialog and Resource Analysis Markers.
</p>
<p>
This plug-in analyzes the system, using buses
as a power cable with components providing
or consuming power.
When the system is being analyzed, the following properties are processed:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>SEI::PowerCapacity</strong></li>
	<li><strong>SEI::PowerBudget</strong></li>
	<li><strong>SEI::PowerSupply</strong></li>
</ul>


<h3>Analyze Resource Allocation</h3>
<p>
The intent of the resource allocation analysis is to take into cons ideration allocation
decisions of application components to processors and to memory. The allocations are
specified through the Actual_Processor_Binding and Actual_Memory_Binding
properties. In addition, this analysis takes into account any specification of actual
resource usage � if present, such as execution time of threads, or actual memory
requirements of application source code.
Both the processor allocation and memory allocation analysis are invoked through the
Analyze Resource Allocation command, available through the toolbar or through the
Analysis menu and the Architecture submenu.
</p>

<h4>Actual Bindings</h4>
<p>
Binding properties are specified in the properties section of the system implementation
that contains both the execution platform and the application system. It is specified as a
�contained� property association with its reference value being the path to the processor
or memory and the applies to clause specifying the component in the containment
hierarchy for which the property value is specified � also a path in the containment
hierarchy. In other words, all binding information is kept in this property section and
effectively represents a binding configuration. For example:
</p>
<pre>
Actual_Processor_Binding => reference platform.MissionProcessor1
applies to App.FlightManager;
</pre>

<h4>Processor allocation</h4>\
<p>
The Actual_Processor_Binding property can be associated with threads, thread groups,
processes, or systems. In an architecture model of major subsystems represented by
system subcomponents or process subcomponents the whole subsystem is allocated to a
specific processor. If specified for a component with subcomponents, the property value
applies to all subcomponents unless they have their own property association. This is due
to the fact that Actual_Processor_Binding is defined as inherit.
</p>
<p>
For processor bindings the Resource Allocation Analysis works as follows. For each
processor instance it identifies the application components that are bound to this
processor. For each of these application components the analysis examines the budget
specification (MIPSBudget) and the actual resource consumption specification in terms
of a period (Period) and execution time (Compute_Execution_Time). If the latter are
specified their values are converted into MIPS and compared to the budget.
Discrepancies are reported. The actual values, or the budget if the actual does not exist,
are totaled up and compared against the capacity of the processor to which the
components are bound.
</p>
<p>
This allows the user to make allocation decisions by reflecting them in the actual
processor binding property. Early in the development those decisions are validated in
terms of MIPS budget specifications. Later in the development, when timing information
about components is available it can be added into the model. This may be done for the
whole model or for some of the application components. The actuals are compared
against the budgets and are used in the totaling of the resource demand on a processor.
</p>
<p>
Note: The application system may have been defined as a nested set of components, each
with a budget. As mentioned above the processor binding is inherited, i.e., both the
parent and its children may have a processor binding value. In that case only the actual
or budget MIPS of the children are totaled in order to avoid double counting of bound
application component budgets.
</p>

<h4>Memory Allocation</h4>
<p>
For memory allocation analysis we have introduced a RAMActual and a ROMActual
property. These properties allow users to specify the actual memory demands of
application components. In case of nested application components with RAMActual or
ROMActual property values, the actual value accounts for memory demands of that
component only. In other words, contrary to the memory budget figures, the actual value
does not represent a cumulative memory demand.
</p>
<p>
These two properties have been provided such that users can reflect actual memory
usage, e.g., as reported by a compiler, without having to provide details. In the future the
actual RAM and ROM values can be calculated automatically from more detailed
specifications such as the Source_Code_Size and Source_Data_Size values on processes,
threads, ports, data, and subcomponents. Similarly, the memory capacity can
automatically be calculated from detailed memory specifications in terms of Word_Count
and Word_Size.
</p>
<p>
The memory allocation analysis compares the actuals, if specified, against the budgets
and compares the total actuals or budgets against the capacity of the memory to which
they are bound.
</p>

<h4>Network Bandwidth Analysis</h4>
<p>
Network bandwidth analysis is supported in two variants: analysis based on inferred
binding of connections to buses; and analysis based on explicit binding of connections to
buses. Each of the two variants supports taking into consideration loopback
communication of connections within the same processor. In case of loopback
communication, intra-processor communication is also routed through the network. This
technique allows application components to be relocated to different processors without
impacting the load on the network.
</p>

<h4>Properties</h4>
<p>
This analysis check the processor load (using MIPS budget and capacity), 
and the memory load (with the memory bound to the processes and using
the RAM and ROM budget/capacities). It also check the bus load
according to the bus bandwidth and its bound connections.
When the system is being analyzed, the following properties are processed:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>ReferenceProcessor</strong>: thread has to be associated
	with a reference processor.</li>
	<li><strong>SEI::BandWidthCapacity</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Actual_Connection_Binding</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Actual_Processor_Binding</strong></li>
	<li><strong>SEI::BandWidthBudget</strong></li>
	<li><strong>SEI::Data_Rate</strong></li>
	<li><strong>SEI::ROMActual</strong></li>
	<li><strong>SEI::RAMActual</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Source_Data_Size</strong>: used on feature (computation of the rate)</li>
	<li><strong>Period</strong>: used on features (rate computation)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Analyze Resources Budgets</h3>
<p>
The intent of the resource budget analysis is to provide resource budgeting support early
in the development life cycle. Users may have defined a system model that essentially is
a high level parts list, i.e., defines the execution platform in terms of a collection of
processors, memory, buses, and the application system in terms of major subsystems that
may or may not be executed as separate partitions.
The components may not yet have features, nor do their implementations have
connections. The application components may not have been elaborated beyond the first
level of application subsystems, which may be represented as AADL systems, or as
AADL processes if we know that they represent partitions with protected address space
boundaries. The capacities and budgets can be associated with these components � with
the type, implementation, or each subcomponent declaration.
</p>
<p>
The resource budget analysis works on system instance models. In other words you will
first instantiate your model by selecting the root system implementation. Typically this
system implementation contains two system components, one representing the execution
platform, the other the application system.
The resource budget analysis is invoked through a toolbar command, or through the
Analysis menu and the Architecture submenu.
The resource budget analysis totals up all the processor capacities and all the MIPS
budgets of application systems and processes and comparing the totals. The same is done
for RAM, ROM, and Bandwidth. Note that these totals represent the total system
capacity in terms of MIPS, memory, and bus bandwidth and the total system demand in
terms of those measures.
</p>
<p>
As the application architecture of a system is refined we may have components with
resource budgets that contain subcomponents with resource budgets. This applies to
MIPS, RAM, and ROM resources. In this case the resource budget analysis tool will add
up the budgets of the subcomponents and compare them to the budget of the enclosing
component. It will use this number as the resource demand of the enclosing component to
total up the demand. It will also compare this number against the specified budget of the
enclosing component and report any difference (under- and over-allocation of the budget
to subcomponents).
</p>
<p>
Bandwidth budget specification requires connections to be declared in the architecture
model as they are associated with connections. This can be done by specifying the
BandWidthBudget for a connection declaration in the component library (declarative
AADL model) or for port connection instances in the instance model.
The resource budget analysis also keeps track of the number of components for which no
capacity or budget has been specified.
The results of the analysis are reported in two ways:
</p>
<ol>
<li>As a summary in a dialog box</li>
<li>As a collection of markers on the instance model resource</li>
</ol>
<p>
In addition to recording the results shown in the dialog box as markers, each component
without a capacity or budget is tagged with a marker. The results can be viewed through
the Problem view. The Problem view can be filtered to show only the resource analysis
results. This is done by selecting the Resource Analysis Marker in the Problem view
filter. The marker results can also be turned into a report in HTML format. This is done
through the Generate Report command in the OSATE menu.
</p>
<p>
When the system is being analyzed, the following properties are processed:
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ReferenceProcessor</strong> for thread, indicate on which
processor the metrics are valid (such as execution time, etc.)</li>
<li><strong>SEI::RAMCapacity</strong></li>
<li><strong>SEI::ROMBudget</strong></li>
<li><strong>SEI::RAMCapacity</strong></li>
<li><strong>SEI::ROMBudget</strong></li>
<li><strong>SEI::MIPSCapacity</strong></li>
<li><strong>SEI::MIPSBudget</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
Upon successful analysis, the plugin reports metrics
in a dialog box, as shown in the following picture.
</p>

<img src="budget-statistics.png"/>

<h3>ARINC429 Consistency Checking</h3>
<p>
One development scenario is that subcontractors develop their subsystems independently and each subcontractor documents how the data it communicates via an ARINC429 protocol is packaged into ARINC429 words. As a result there can be inconsistencies in terms of which package ID and which bit locations data is transferred in. It is then the responsibility of the integrator to detect any inconsistencies.
</p>
<p>
We can support such consistency checking of ARINC429 protocol usage by making use of properties on ports or on features of port group types. The data communicated through ports are mapped into ARINC429 words using the following properties:
</p>

<ul>
<li>ARINC429::WordID: This integer valued property records the unique ID of the ARINC429 word in which the data is to be transferred.
</li>
<li>
ARINC429::firstbit: The location of the first bit within the ARINC429 word.
</li>
<li>
ARINC429::numberbits: The number of bits making up the data element.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
The ARINC429 consistency checker is invoked on an instance model using the toolbar button or via the Analyses menu. It works with all port connection instances and compares the three ARINC429 property values, if both the source and destination ports have them. The checker also records all port connection instances and their ARINC429 properties in a CSV file for processing by MS Excel or other tools.
</p>
<p>
Note that the numberbits property is redundant with the Source_Data_Size property. We chose to provide the numberbits property as separate property in order to support a development process where a team member, who is responsible for the mapping to the ARINC429 protocol, can work independently. We can extend the consistency checker to ensure that the numberbits property and the Source_Data_Size property have consistent values, or the Source_Data_Size property is used when the numberbits property value is not present.
</p>

<h3>Port Connection Consistency Checking</h3>
<p>
For every port connection instance the checker retrieves properties from the source port and the destination port and compares them. Port connection instances are always created between port instances of the lowest level component instances in the instance model. This means that for a model with processes or systems as the lowest components the connection instances start with and end with process or system ports. When the model is refined to the thread level the port connection instances are created between thread instance ports.
</p>
<p>
When feature groups are defined and they contain ports, then the instance contains a separate port connection instance for each port.  In other words, the port connection checker validates the consistency for each port in the feature group.
</p>
<p>
The following properties are currently compared:</p>

<ul>
<li>Source_Data_Size: this property indicates the size of the data communicated through the port.  The property may be associated 1) with the data type (data component classifier) referenced by the port, or 2) with the port itself.  The size is expected to be equal. This check is performed if both ports have a property value specified.
</li>
<li>
Input_Rate and Output_Rate: this property indicates the expected input/output rate. It is a record value specifying a Value_range of real values and a Rate_Unit (PerDispatch or PerSecond). The Rate_Unit is expected to be equal and the source value range is expected to be contained in the destination value range. This check is performed if the source port has an output rate and the destination port has an input rate specified.
</li>
<li>
SEI::Data_Rate: real value representing the rate without unit (assumed to be transfers per second); must be same value. Note: this property is provided as an alternative to using Input_Rate and OutPut_Rate. This check is performed if both ports have a property value specified.
</li>
<li>
Data_Model::Base_Type: (reference to data classifier); must refer to same classifier. This check is performed if both ports have a property value specified.
</li>
</ul>
<li>
Data_Model::Measurement_Unit: (string); must be equal. This check is performed if both ports have a property value specified.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
These properties are associated with the ports, with data component types that are the port classifiers, or with the port features of feature group types.
</p>
<p>
If a property value is missing for one or both ports no comparison is made and a message is reported.  
</p>
<p>
For all port connection instances the source and destination port property values are recorded in a CSV file for processing by MS Excel. The resulting file can be found in the reports folder.
</p>


<h3>Security and safety Plug-In</h3>

<h4>Security</h4>
<p>
This analysis checks whether the security level of a component with an outgoing connection does not exceed the security level of the component this connection leads to. This analysis can be performed on declarative AADL models and on AADL instance models.  The analysis is invoked on a declarative model or on an instance model using �Analyses > Security > Check Security Levels� or the button.  When invoked on an AADL specification, all declarative model files in the workspace are analyzed.  When invoked on a component implementation, all component declarations that are part of its system hierarchy are analyzed.  When invoked on an instance model, only the instance model is checked.  This analyses is more complete when analyzing system instances; when analyzing declarative models it does not understand modes.
 
The security level is specified on components, i.e., on component type, component implementation, or subcomponent declarations. The check can be invoked on an AADL XML file, or on any of the AADL model objects in the AADL Object Editor. The analysis plug-in performs this check for all connections if either or both ports have a value for this property. The analysis plug-in expects the property SEI::SecurityLevel, an aadlinteger-valued property to be defined in the SEI property set, i.e.,
</p>
<pre>
Property set SEI is 
  SecurityLevel:
    aadlinteger applies to (system, process, thread group, thread);
End SEI;
</pre>
<p>
For declarative AADL models this analysis performs two functions.  First, it ensures that a component has a security level that is the maximum of the security levels of its subcomponents. Second, it checks all connections to determine whether the source component of a connection declaration has a security level that is the same or lower than that of the destination component.  If a component does not have a SecurityLevel property declared its value is assumed to be zero, i.e., the lowest security level.
 
The first check is performed for every component implementation that is part of the system hierarchy of the root component implementation.  If the component implementation does not have this property, but at least one of its subcomponents does, then the property value will be set to the maximum value for the component implementation.  If the enclosing component implementation already has a SecurityLevel value and it is less than the maximum of the subcomponent security levels, its value will be updated to the maximum.
 
The analysis propagates the security level value up the system hierarchy in one of two ways.  If the analysis is invoked on an Aadl model instance (either the corresponding aaxl resource or any model object of the model instance), then the component hierarchy of the system instance is traversed in postfix order (bottom up) to evaluate each component implementation that is a classifier for the subcomponent that is represented by a component instance object in the instance model.  If the analysis is invoked on an AadlSpec (either the corresponding aaxl resource or any model object of an AadlSpec), then the analysis works bottom up through the component classifier library.  This means it starts with component implementations with out subcomponents, and then recursively processes component implementations, whose subcomponents have the already processed component implementations as classifiers. 

The second check is performed after the security level values have been propagated up the system hierarchy.  This check compares the security levels of the source and destination components in connection declarations.

<h4>Check Safety Levels</h4>
<p>
This analysis checks whether the safety criticality level of a component with an outgoing connection is higher or equal to the safety criticality level of the component at the destination end of the connection. The idea is that a component with lower safety criticality should not drive the operation of a component with a higher safety criticality.
 
The analysis is invoked on a declarative model or on an instance model using �Analyses > Security > Check Safety Levels� or the button.  When invoked on an AADL specification, all declarative model files in the workspace are analyzed.  When invoked on a component implementation, all component declarations that are part of its system hierarchy are analyzed. When invoked on an instance model, only the instance model is checked.  This analyses is more complete when analyzing system instances; when analyzing declarative models it does not understand modes.
 
The safety criticality level is specified on components, i.e., on component type, component implementation, or subcomponent declarations using the property SEI::SafetyCriticality, an aadlinteger valued property defined in the SEI property set, i.e.,
</p> 
<pre>
Property set SEI is
 
  SafetyCriticality:
 
    aadlinteger applies to (system, process, thread group, thread);
 
End SEI;
</pre> 
<p>
For declarative AADL models this analysis checks all connections to determine whether the source component of a connection declaration has a safety criticality level that is the same or higher than that of the destination component.  If a component does not have a SafetyCriticality property declared its value is assumed to be zero, i.e., the lowest safety level.
