<H2>OSATE plug-in: SEI validation plug-ins</H2>


<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
The analysis plugins designed by the SEI are available in the <em>Analyses</em>, as
shown in the picture below. These plugins mostly acts on the instance model and thus
you need to select the instance model and the root system instance when invoking these
plugins.
</p>

<p>
Most of the plugins report errors and information in the Eclipse <em>Problems</em>
view. For this reason, this is always worth to activate this view when
using the validation plug-ins. You can activate this view by selecting
the following menus: <em>Window</em>, <em>Show View</em> and then <em>Problems</em>, as
shown in the following picture.
</p>

<p>
Eclipse classifies information into different categories: errors, warning and
information. On some Eclipse installation, the problem view sometimes does not report
all informations but the plug-ins use these different report categories.
To be sure to enable all potential information from the plugin, make sure the problem
view show all information, as shown below.

<h3>Statistics plug-in</h3>
<p>
This plug-in aims at making statistics on your model: number of components,
categories of components, etc. This plug-in is more a support
for new plug-in developer and start with an established code base
they can re-use.
</p>

<h3>Flow Latency Analysis</h3>
<p>
This plug-in performs a latency analysis of your connection flows.
More information about this plug-in can be also found in the
<a href="http://www.sei.cmu.edu/reports/07tn010.pdf" target="blank">following technical report</a>.
In order to work correctly, you must model a system with flow and define 
the property <em>Transmission_Time</em> on <em>bus</em> components.
You can see the definition of such a property above:
</p>
<pre>
bus mybus
properties
   Transmission_Time => [ Fixed => 0 ms .. 10ms;
                          PerByte => 0 ms .. 10 ms; ];
end mybus; 
</pre>

<p>
You must also define the <em>SEI::BandWidthBudget</em> property,
like that:
</p>
<pre>
SEI::BandWidthBudget => 1.0 KBytesps; 
</pre>

<p>
Also, when declaring <strong>flows</strong>, you must declare
the <em>latency</em> property, like the following:
</p>
<pre>
process myprocess
features
   pout: out data port;
   busAccess: requires bus access mybus;
flows
   myflow_src: flow source pout {latency => 1 ns .. 2 ns; } ; 
end myprocess;
</pre>

<p>
Once your model is done, you can execute the analysis from the menu on the
instance model. To do so, select the root node of the instance
model and click on <em>Analysis</em> and then <em>Check Flow Latency</em>.
Once the plug-in finished, a report is generated in a directory called <em>reports</em>,
it can be opened with a spreadsheet such as LibreOffice or Microsoft Excel.
</p>


<h3>Security Plug-In</h3>
<p>
The security plug-in make an evaluation of the system according to
the security levels of each process and its mode. For that, the
model must define the properties <em>SEI::SecurityLevel</em>
on appropriate components. The
