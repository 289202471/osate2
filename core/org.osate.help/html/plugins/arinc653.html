<H2>OSATE plug-in: ARINC653 framework</H2>
<p>
The ARINC653 validation framework provides functionality for analyzing AADL
models that use the ARINC653 annex. The annex is available
as <a href="http://standards.sae.org/as5506/2/">a SAE standard</a>.
The plug-in provides the following functionalities:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Connection latency analysis</strong>: report
		the worst case time for exchanging a data from one partition
		to another.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Refactoring suggestion</strong>: suggest potential
		improvement regarding architecture characteristics such as
		partition criticality levels, separation across different
		partitions, etc.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Memory dimensioning validation</strong>: check
		that memory segment size is correct regarding partition needs.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Major Frame configuration</strong>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Partitions Binding</strong>: each partition
		is associated to a virtual processor.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Partitions execution</strong>: each partition
		is executed at least one time by the separation kernel.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Interaction between partitions having different criticality levels</strong>:
		show warning when partitions having different criticality levels are connected.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Space isolation</strong>: check that each partition is associated to 
		a separate memory segment.
	</li>

	
</ul>
