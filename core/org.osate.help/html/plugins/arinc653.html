<H2>OSATE plug-in: ARINC653 framework</H2>
<p>
The ARINC653 validation framework provides functionality for analyzing AADL
models that use the ARINC653 annex. The annex is available
as <a href="http://standards.sae.org/as5506/2/">a SAE standard</a>.
The plug-in provides the following functionalities:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Connection latency analysis</strong>: report
		the worst case time for exchanging a data from one partition
		to another.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Refactoring suggestion</strong>: suggest potential
		improvement regarding architecture characteristics such as
		partition criticality levels, separation across different
		partitions, etc.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Memory dimensioning validation</strong>: check
		that memory segment size is correct regarding partition needs.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Major Frame configuration</strong>
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Partitions Binding</strong>: each partition
		is associated to a virtual processor.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Partitions execution</strong>: each partition
		is executed at least one time by the separation kernel.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Interaction between partitions having different criticality levels</strong>:
		show warning when partitions having different criticality levels are connected.
	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Space isolation</strong>: check that each partition is associated to 
		a separate memory segment.
	</li>

	
</ul>

<h3>Connection Latency Analysis</h3>
<p>
When using the connection latency analysis plug-in, your system must be
composed of one or several partitions (AADL process components)
associated to partitions runtime (AADL virtual processor). For that,
the process must be bound with the partition runtime
using the <em>Actual_Processor_Binding</em> property.
</p>
<p>
Then, the processor itself must describe its scheduling policy using the
properties <em>ARINC653::Partition_Slots</em>, <em>ARINC653::Slots_Allocation</em>
and <em>ARINC653::Module_Major_Frame</em>.
</p>
<p>
When partitions are located on different processor (distributed architecture),
the connection pass through a bus. We can also take into account the binding
of a device to its execution partition as well. For that, the connection
has to pass through the partition source, the devices (sender and receiver)
and the receiver partition.
Also, the analysis takes into account the latency
associated to the bus used in the connection.
</p>


<h3>Model example</h3>
<p>
The following model can be used to test the ARINC653 validation functions.
