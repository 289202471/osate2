<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
<h3>Standard properties are not found</h3>
<p>
To fix that, you have to add the standard properties again. Right click
on your project or model and select <em>Create/update Predeclared and
Annex Properties</em>, as shown below.

<h3>Reasons for errors when instantiating models</h3>
<p>
There are the main reasons for having a model that does not instantiate:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
	<strong>Connection between two components that inherit features</strong>: not supported for now. This error
	is triggered when you try to connect two components that inherits the same component (and such, share the
	same inherited features).
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Why cannot we use our own AADL_Project file ?</h3>
<p>
Using your own <em>AADL_Project</em> file would conflict with the
files provided by the plug-in. There are possibilities for supporting
that but it would rather impact user experience. On the other hand,
it could be done by following this process:
</p>
<ol>
   <li>Delete the <em>AADL_Project</em> file from the plug-in resources</li>
   <li>Create a new project with your own <em>AADL_Project</em> file (let's call it <em>myproperties</em></li>
   <li>Introduce a dependency between <em>Plugin_Resources</em> and <em>myproperties</em>. 
   To do so, select <em>Plugin_Resources</em>, click on the <em>Project</em> menu and then <em>Properties</em>.
   Finally, in the project references, select <em>myproperties</em>. </li>
</ol>
