<h2>Error-Model Annex v2 and Fault-Tree Analysis</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Fault-Tree Analysis is a graphical representation of several faults
that contributes to generate a failures. This is used by several safety/relalibility
evaluation process, such as ARP4761. The following paragraphs explains the mapping rules
between an AADL model and its Error-Model Annex into a Fault-Tree representation.
</p>
<p>
A complete wikipedia article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tree_analysis">
explains the representation format for FTA</a>.
</p>

<h3>Mapping to XML file</h3>
<p>
Most of Fault-Tree Analysis tools are proprietary and use a specific
format. Thus, exporting the AADL notation into a tool requires
to produce a file using a specific format and would avoid to use
another tool. On the other hand, one solution is to use
a general-purpose and open file format that can be easily processed
to export into specific representation, for each FTA-related tool.
</p>
<p>
The XML file is composed of one or several XML nodes called <em>event</em>
that may contain themselves <em>event</em> children nodes. The <em>event</em>
node may have the following attributes:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>id</strong> (required): unique identifier of the event</li>
	<li><strong>description</strong> (optional): description of the event</li>
	<li><strong>type</strong> (optional): indicate if the event is a composite
	of other events. If present, the value can be one of the following
		<ol>
			<li><strong>and</strong>: the event sub-items are required
			in order to trigger the current event</li>
			<li><strong>or</strong>: only one event from the events sub-items
			needs to be triggered in order to trigger the current event.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li><strong>probability</strong> (optional): probability that the current
	event is raised</li>
</ul>
<p>
An example of such an XML file is shown below.
</p>

<h3>Using the FTA generator</h3>
<p>
To use the FTA generator, you have to select a system instance
and invoke the FTA tool on the root system. A dialog box will ask
the error state (in terms of component behavior state)
that corresponds to the error, as shown below.

<p>
The file is then produced into the <em>reports/</em> sub-directory,
as shown below.

<h3>AADL and PRISM mapping rules</h3>
<p>
To generate an FTA, we used the <em>composite error behavior</em>, as for the RDB.
As a consequence, in order to generate a complete FTA, we need first
to define the composite error behavior of the main system instance.

<h3>Example of produced XML file</h3>

<div align="left"><font face="courier new">&lt;event id="Failed state"&nbsp; type="or"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;event id="Failed/AircraftFMS_i_Instance"&nbsp; type="and" description=""description from aircraft failure""&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;event id="Failed/Actuator1"&nbsp; description=""description from actuator failure""&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/event&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;event id="Failed/Actuator2"&nbsp; description=""description from actuator failure""&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/event&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/event&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;event id="Failed/PositionSensor"&nbsp; description=""description from sensor failure""&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/event&gt;<br>&lt;/event&gt;&gt;<br></font></div>

<h3>Issues and known limitations</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Draft function under development</li>
	<li>Need to be experienced on large models</li>
</ul>
