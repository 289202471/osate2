<h2>Error-Model Annex v2 and Fault-Tree Analysis</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
Fault-Tree Analysis is a graphical representation of several faults
that contributes to generate a failures. This is used by several safety/reliability
evaluation processes, such as ARP4761. The following paragraphs explains the mapping rules
between an AADL model and its Error-Model Annex into a Fault-Tree representation.
</p>
<p>
A complete wikipedia article <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fault_tree_analysis">
explains the representation format for FTA</a>.
</p>


<h3>Using the FTA generator</h3>
<p>
To use the FTA generator, you have to select a system instance
and invoke the FTA tool on the root system. A dialog box will ask
the error state (in terms of component behavior state)
that corresponds to the error, as shown below.
</p>

<p>
The file is then produced into the <em>reports/</em> sub-directory,
as shown below.
</p>

<p>
Two types of files are generated:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>OpenFTA format, suitable to be used directly in 
		<a href="http://www.openfta.com/" target="blank">OpenFTA</a>
	</li>
	<li>
		A generic XML format that can be exported to other notation
		suitable for commercial tools.
	</li>
</ol>

<h3>Mapping to OpenFTA format file</h3>
<p>
The mapping into <a href="http://www.openfta.com/" target="blank">OpenFTA</a> provides a solution to use directly
the FTA in a tool available to everyone at no-cost. Even if this tool has
some limitation, it is a convenient way to visualize the fault-tree
of your system. Once the report is generated it can be used directly
within <a href="http://www.openfta.com/" target="blank">OpenFTA</a>. The figure below shows one example of an exported model.
</p>

<h3>Mapping to generic XML format</h3>
<p>
Most of Fault-Tree Analysis tools are proprietary and use a specific
format. Thus, exporting the AADL notation into a tool requires
to produce a file using a specific format and would avoid to use
another tool. On the other hand, one solution is to use
a general-purpose and open file format that can be easily processed
to export into specific representation, for each FTA-related tool.
</p>
<p>
The XML file is composed of one or several XML nodes called <em>event</em>
that may contain themselves <em>event</em> children nodes. The <em>event</em>
node may have the following attributes:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>id</strong> (required): unique identifier of the event</li>
	<li><strong>description</strong> (optional): description of the event</li>
	<li><strong>type</strong> (optional): indicate if the event is a composite
	of other events. If present, the value can be one of the following
		<ol>
			<li><strong>and</strong>: the event sub-items are required
			in order to trigger the current event</li>
			<li><strong>or</strong>: only one event from the events sub-items
			needs to be triggered in order to trigger the current event.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li><strong>probability</strong> (optional): probability that the current
	event is raised</li>
</ul>
<p>
An example of such an XML file is shown below.
</p>

<h3>AADL and FTA mapping rules</h3>
<p>
To generate an FTA, we used the <em>composite error behavior</em>, as for the RDB.
As a consequence, in order to generate a complete FTA, we need first
to define the composite error behavior of the main system instance.
</p>

<p>
The tool browses the composite error model of the top-level component
and process all the path of the error tree defined by the composite error
model. Ultimately, leaf nodes are either <em>error states</em>, <em>error events</em> or
<em>incoming error propagations</em>. For example, let's consider the following
behavior model and component definition:
</p>
<pre>
error behavior Simple
events
	Failure : error event ;
states
	Operational : initial state ;
	Failed : state ;
transitions
	BadValueTransition : Operational -[ Failure ]-> Failed ;
end behavior ;


system s
features
	datain : in data port mydata; 
annex EMV2 {**
	use types ErrorModelLibrary;
	use behavior ErrorModelLibrary::Simple;
	
	error propagations
		datain : in propagation {BadValue};
	flows
		f0 : error sink datain {BadValue};
	end propagations;
	component error behavior
	transitions
		t0 : Operational -[datain{BadValue}]-> Failed;
	end component;
**};
end s;
</pre>

<p>
In that case, its transition to the failing state
will be shown with the occurrence of an incoming
error on <em>datain</em> or an occurrence of
the error event <em>failure</em>.
</p>

<h3>Example of produced XML file</h3>

<div align="left"><font face="courier new">&lt;event id="Failed state"&nbsp; type="or"&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;event id="Failed/AircraftFMS_i_Instance"&nbsp; type="and" description=""description from aircraft failure""&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;event id="Failed/Actuator1"&nbsp; description=""description from actuator failure""&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/event&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;event id="Failed/Actuator2"&nbsp; description=""description from actuator failure""&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/event&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/event&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;event id="Failed/PositionSensor"&nbsp; description=""description from sensor failure""&gt;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/event&gt;<br>&lt;/event&gt;&gt;<br></font></div>

<h3>Issues and known limitations</h3>
<ul>
	<li>When installing OpenFTA, you may have an error. On Windows 7, you have
	    to right-click on the installer and change the compatibility options and check,
	    make sure to execute the software under the Windows 2000 compatibility mode.
	 </li>
	<li>At that point, when the same error event can contribute to several faults,
	    it is duplicated in the FTA (with different identifiers). This is due to a limitation
	    with the analysis tool.
	</li>
	<li>
		Each event can only have two sub-events.
	</li>
</ul>
