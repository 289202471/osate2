<h2>Error-Model Annex v2 and PRISM support</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
PRISM is a model-checking tool for processing Markov-Chain.
It supports different models such as Discrete Time Markov-Chain (DTMC)
or Continuous Time Markov-Chain (CTMC).
You can learn more about PRISM on the official website 
<a href="http://www.prismmodelchecker.org/">www.prismmodelchecker.org</a>.
</p>


<h3>AADL export to PRISM function</h3>
<p>
In order to make some reliability/fault analysis of a system, 
the use of formal method can be really useful. Then, you need
to transform the architecture model into a representation
suitable for model-checking tool. In our case, the AADL to PRISM
transforms an AADL specification into a PRISM model, either 
a DTMC or CTMC.
</p>

<p>
The AADL model can be exported either in a DTMC or a CTMC:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>The <strong>DTMC</strong> model use probability unrelated
	with time. Thus, it shall be used when specifying occurrence value
	with the <em>Fixed</em> distribution parameter.
	</li>
	<li>The <strong>DTMC</strong> model use probability related
	with time (exponential distribution). Thus, it shall be used when specifying occurrence value
	with the <em>Poisson</em> distribution parameter.
	</li>	 
</ul>

Component state
</td>
<td>
Local variable of a module with <em>component_name_state</em>. 
The number of values depends on the number of states 
in the state machine associated to the component. 
This variable is always initialized with 0.

<td>
Component state value

As much values as the number of states.

Nothing. On the other hand, when the port as an in

Command with probability. The probability 
value is deduced from the associated 
occurrence value from the AADL property 
<em>OccurrenceDistribution</em>.

                               prob2: (component_state’=otherstateval)
</pre>
</td>

<tr>
<td>
State change due to an incoming fault propagation
</td>
<td>
Command with the name of the current state and/or 
the corresponding outgoing port from the sender component.
<pre>
[] component_state=stateval & sendercomponent_name_outportname=val -> (component_state’=newstateval)

<h3>Issues and known limitations</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Support of the whole component hierarchy, we support only the first nesting level of component hierarchy</li>
	<li>Connection to the behavior annex to inject error/behavior-related information between the two annexes</li>
	<li>Does not support different error types when analyzing component propagations</li>
	<li>Does not use components bindings</li>
</ul>
