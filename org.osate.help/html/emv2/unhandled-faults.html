<h2>Error-Model Annex v2 - Unhandled Faults</h2>

<h3>Rationale</h3>
<p>
When reusing components in an architecture, we may reuse their related
error description. However, when reusing the component, some faults
propagated may not be handled by the components connected to it. Also,
components that are connected may expect to receive fault types
that are not propagated.
</p>

<h3>Using the Unhandled Fault function</h3>
<p>
To use the function, select your instance model and select the
<em>UnhandledFaults</em> function in the <em>Fault Analysis menu</em>, as shown
below.
</p>

<h3>Type of faults under analysis</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Components with error source not connected to any error path</li>
	<li>Components with error sink not connected to any error source</li>
	<li>Coverage of all fault types across error propagations. For example,
	if the model defines fault types <em>TimingError</em> with two subtypes: 
	<em>LateDelivery</em> and <em>EarlyDelivery</em>. Then, when having a component
	propagating <em>LateDelivery</em>, the tool must make sure that the connected
	component handled this type or the super-type <em>TimingError</em>.
	Also, the tool must check that the receiving component
	handle all error sub-types: <em>EarlyDelivery</em> and <em>LateDelivery</em>.
	In other words, it checks that all types of faults are handled.

</ul>
