<h2>Error-Model Annex v2 - Reliability Block Diagram</h2>
<p>
A Reliability Block Diagram (RDB) is a simple representation
of a system with reliability/safety-related information.
You can learn more about this representation on 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reliability_block_diagram" target="blank">wikipedia</a>.
While being first a graphical representation, the RDB
is also helpful to have a first gross estimation 
of the error probability.
</p>

<p>
To do so, you have to associate an occurence value for each potential error/fault.
In AADL terms, it consists in assigning an <em>OccurrenceDistribution</em> property
to an error model artifact (see example below). Also, in AADL, the
RDB is specified with an <em>error composite behavior</em> specification that
details the dependence between each state. In the example below, 
the main system is Operational if:
</p>
<ol>
	<li>the sensor is Operational</li>
	<li>at least one actuator is Operational</li>
</ol> 

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>
The following example is composed of three devices: a sensor and
two actuators. The system is operational as long as a sensor is
operational and at least one actuator is operational. All
devices are associated to the same processor. The following
picture show the graphical instance model.

<p>
Then, using the RDB function from the tool framework, we can
compute metrics that show the probability of having (or not)
failures. The following figure show the result of our plug-in
on the following example (see below). The result show the metrics
but also which components are used to produce this metrics
so that the user can also check that all components
are correctly being processed.

The following AADL textual model gives an overview of the
definition of the main system instance.

<h3>Known issues and/or limitations</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Work with fixed probability only</li>
	<li>Does not work with error propagations</li>
